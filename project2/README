In order to compile:
On a linux machine, run 'make'

Note: requires boost-devel, libatomic_ops (libatomic_ops-devel in fedora 16)

To invoke:
./simple_test [num_threads] [ [TASLOCK]|[TTASLOCK]|[BACKOFF]|[ALOCK] ] [MINDELAY=<seconds>] [MAXDELAY=<seconds>]

This program spawns <num_threads> and each thread increments a counter to 10000.
OR
./second_test ... [SECONDS=<seconds>]
This program runs for <seconds> and each thread increments a counter.  At the end it reports what the counter reached and total nanoseconds spent calling the lock() method.
