\subsection{Results of Profiling}

The following results came from running on a Linux x86\_64 with an AMD Phenom II X6 1055T Processor (6 discrete cores).
These results are generated using each algorithm running with 100 threads and using \verb+pthread_yield()+ (in order to have up to 100 threads).
The results, gathered using \verb+gprof+, are summarized in Table \ref{table:profile}

\begin{table}[hp]
    \caption{Profile Results}
    \begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{|r||c|c|c|}
        \hline Algorithm & \% of Time in lock() & \% of Time in unlock() & \% of Time in worker\_thread \\
        \hline ALOCK & 96.75 & 0.40 & 2.85 \\
        \hline TASLOCK & 77.20 & 0 & 22.87 \\
        \hline TTASLOCK & 75.06 & 0 & 25.02 \\
        \hline BACKOFF & 59.71 & 0.84 & 7.57 \\
        \hline PTHREAD & 0.0 & 33.36 & 66.72 \\
        \hline
    \end{tabular}
    \end{center}
    \label{table:profile}
\end{table}

As a note, some of the algorithms don't add up to 100\%.
This is because time was spent making other calls, such as the \verb+backoff()+ call in BACKOFF.
