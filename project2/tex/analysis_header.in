\section{Analysis}

The results below were generated using two global 64 bit counters, one for the `c' variable below and one for `t'.  The time in the lock was then taken as $ t / c $
\begin{verbatim}
t = 0
while(timespent < SECONDS)
{
    lock1 = clock.gettime()
    lock();
    lock2 = clock.gettime()
    t += lock2-lock1
    c++;
    unlock();
}
\end{verbatim}
