\subsection{Time in lock() vs Threads}
The results below were generated using a global counter.  Each thread behaved as below:
\begin{verbatim}
for( 1 second )
    gettime(&time1)
    lock();
    gettime(&time2)
    time_spent += time2 - time1   //time_spent is local to each thread
    counter++;                    //counter is global
    unlock();
\end{verbatim}
At the end, all the threads' time\_spent is added up then divided by counter to get the average time spent in lock().
